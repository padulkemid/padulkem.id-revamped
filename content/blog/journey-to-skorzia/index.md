## üê≤ Beginning of a New Ersoe

*Times are changing, are you satisfied with its results ?*

People change everyday, a war is declared every single hour. There is no turning
back for you who wants blood. Kings of all realms and zone fought each other.
This *ersoe* are by far the worst case indeed. If you are one of their soldiers,
you are doomed.

*"People of Skorzia! In this heavenly day, we will fight Ultrsoe army! Are you
ready for the Red March!?"*

The King howls every morning until he gets all of our armies united. There is
five guilds in Skorzia, each one have a connection between him and Skorzia's
lore. You might not knowing by now but soon, I will tell you.

While everybody is on fire about ***Red March***, *Skubach* the Blacksmith is
getting ready for his majesty. He prepared all the weapons and protections for
those who wants blood to shed in this war. *Skubach* is highly skilled on
creating a very sharp blade.

*"Skubach, did you or did you not like about what The King said this morning?"*

Skubach likes to eat a fresh meat everyday, a Korz ( *you call the throne's
warrior with this* ) always fed his stomach thrice a day. But I really want to
know if he's not sided with The King ( as he wants to clash with people ).

*"I don't know young man, Skorzia conquered Wal'Krathum yesterday and we got
alliances with them, as long my food is delivered I'll support them"*

I have this kind of feeling that we actually dislike any war, we want a peaceful
approachment. Anyway some of the guild's handsman are walking towards me so get
pass by Skubach's place.

## üê≤ King's March

Skorzia's finest source of fighters is from the guilds. I promised you I'll tell
them. Well, here we go: 

---

#### The Annuculanths

Well here we go, this is the first and foremost the strongest guild in Skorzia.
Led by ***Jacculanth the Great*** ( pronounced : *Di-J√¶-SU laandtch* ). A 2324
Years old man, with long-term manuvering beard. As you can imagine, he is really
big in shape. Heights around 3 meters, and weighs for about 2 tons. Picture of a
really tough wall with an iron gate ( double those gates into silver or molten
steel ) and you got it.

Every respect he got is from our people. He is the bravest hero and may all
*Kiric's* strengths with him.

#### The Khragtunths

The second one is **Khragtunths**. As slick as in the shadows, all true-born
assassins came from this guild. ***Shrukantunth the Snake*** ( pronounced: *S-Raa-Kan-TanGtch* ) lead this people
from the unfathomable deep.

They always hide themselves from the community of Skorzia. Seems they follow
some religion or cult or another similar things ( I don't know myself as I'm
just an ordinary people here ).

But I'll tell ya one thing. Khragtunths always win if we march a surprise
attack. ***Always...***

Poison is their main weapon and skills, hence the leader got that nickname.

#### The Bundstonths

Okay you might be knowing this from other country or other stories as well. Even
maybe you heard this from some walking wanderers out there. **Bundstonths** also
called ***Sage of the Wild*** is one of the 9 Pillars of **Kronosz**. As you can
see, Skorzia is on the southern part of Kronosz and all the country have at
least one guild like this one.

Mostly The Bundstonths are formed by the old people who sacrifice their only
life to the *Stontharsz*, the ***The God of the Wild***. They do not have any
leader as their only king is *Stontharsz* but the King has spoken, and they must
join our cause to get into the ***Red March***.

*Bundstonths* are specialized in healing. They can ask the *Judgement of the
Wild* to get the job done. Well, I never did any magic so maybe we'll know soon
if you still here reading this.

#### The Quryanths

***Quryanths*** are the master of Black Magic and dwells the eastern part of Skorzia. Even they only know
how to kill someone or a being but they always knew they could get something.

Do you even know ? Their leader ***Qruzifahs of The East*** is the most evilest
*or demonic* as you say ' being ' in Skorzia. Everytime he kills somebody, he
absorbs the soul of the dead body and get all the powers.

Enough talking, I'm already scared as I pass their **Black Majestic** as I told
you this.

#### The Srotenths

And the last one is ***Srotenths***. There is one word to describe this guild as
we already near our destination. A pacifist. They love peace not war. If the
king already declared an attack or war, Srotenths always against any kind of
violence. They will likely not joining our cause. 

And you can guess, They are the most hatred here. ( might be more, Quryanths
also really hate this guild though ).

We arrived in the northern part of Skorzia. I got mini heart attack while I tell
the tales of the 5 guilds ( All guards are pointing at me! ). Luckily, I got
escaped and that *'phewwwww'* moment.

For the last time, all armies from the guilds are getting their best and best
offensive thing to deal with *Ultrsoe* ( after we conquer Wal'Krathum ). This is
not the best way to get all my stuffs, I should get prepared for all the things.

*"Where the hell are you son? We've been waiting here for so long?"*

Father wants me to accompany him into the fields, get our lunch. Another 1 or 2
fish well either things are good, so we saddle up our horses.

*And suddenly...*

*"Where zu ya zing zu goan?"*

Yup, A Korz approaches us. I don't know what to do so I let my father handle
him. 

*"Son..."*

*"Let's go for another walk shall we, lets put our horse here in home, and we
walk"*

Then we walked...  
To the fields...  
with an arrow...  

## üê≤ Skorzia Barren Waste-d

As we arrived in the desert ( well it should not be a desert ) maybe a
*greenland*, and I see all of the nightmare you could phase in your dreams.

All of the bodies are wasted right there in front of my eyes...

*"Father, are we really gonna hunt a kringx ?"*

I gaze upon soldiers of Ultrsoe that has been slaughtered as they spies on our
defenses. All Korz have been called to home 2 hours ago, I thought so. I should
never do anything about war.

*"This maybe kringxes not Korz."*

*"But father, are your eyes so closed that you couldn't see that flag?"*

*"No son, keep on your knees, let's move"*

As we climb the mountain of the fields, we saw something, *ancient* lying right
there. Its been a rare cause since I saw a thing like this. Maybe it yields some powers
inside. Glowing powers are indeed powerful here in Skorzia, maybe we should gave
this item to the guilds ? Well I don't know, thats my father decision, do not
rush to any conclusion.

*I should stay calm...*

*"Quryanths could use this thing..."*

*"Are you insane father ? Quryanths did bad things to us yesterday"*

*"No son! This is beyond we could imagine!"*

This 'thing' glows even more brighter after we shout things. Maybe it yield
power to destroy 1 country? Even more, might be. I cannot process this kind of
stuff either, we need some clue. Should I pick this stuff? Bring it to the one
who could understand it?

*"Dad, really? Are we gonna bring this out of here or we just gonna leave it?
Maybe the stuff is really bad, Korz want to use it as a decoy to the enemy? If
we take this to the city, this is bad."*

*"Son, if we have this power, it will be remarkable for us, if I could control
it it, I have the utmost ultimate power and could bring joy to all of us!"*

#### SKKKKKRRRRRRRTZZ!!!!

The stone started to vibrate and shake our grounds. I need to think how to get
that stuff out, because maybe Father is already on its command. Dark power?
Mythical power? WHAT SHOULD I DO?

*"Dad, put out that stone now! Its controlling you!"*

*This is bad as my father getting deeper, deeper, and deeper.*

I kicked the stone, my father fainted and Korz started to move towards our spot.
I get up to a carriage next to us and bring my dad. Well as you can see, the
Korz is moving even faster! 

*Panic....*  
*Even more panic....*  
*Even more, and more panic....*
