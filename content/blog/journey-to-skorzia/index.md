## üê≤ Beginning of a New Ersoe

*Times are changing, are you satisfied with its results ?*

People change everyday, a war is declared every single hour. There is no turning
back for you who wants blood. Kings of all realms and zone fought each other.
This *ersoe* are by far the worst case indeed. If you are one of their soldiers,
you are doomed.

*"People of Skorzia! In this heavenly day, we will fight Ultrsoe army! Are you
ready for the Red March!?"*

The King howls every morning until he gets all of our armies united. There is
five guilds in Skorzia, each one have a connection between him and Skorzia's
lore. You might not knowing by now but soon, I will tell you.

While everybody is on fire about ***Red March***, *Skubach* the Blacksmith is
getting ready for his majesty. He prepared all the weapons and protections for
those who wants blood to shed in this war. *Skubach* is highly skilled on
creating a very sharp blade.

*"Skubach, did you or did you not like about what The King said this morning?"*

Skubach likes to eat a fresh meat everyday, a Korz ( *you call the throne's
warrior with this* ) always fed his stomach thrice a day. But I really want to
know if he's not sided with The King ( as he wants to clash with people ).

*"I don't know young man, Skorzia conquered Wal'Krathum yesterday and we got
alliances with them, as long my food is delivered I'll support them"*

I have this kind of feeling that we actually dislike any war, we want a peaceful
approachment. Anyway some of the guild's handsman are walking towards me so get
pass by Skubach's place.

## üê≤ King's March

Skorzia's finest source of fighters is from the guilds. I promised you I'll tell
them. Well, here we go: 

#### The Annuculanths
#### The Khragtunths
#### The Bundstonths
#### The Quryanths
#### The Srotenths
