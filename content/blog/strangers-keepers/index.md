## ðŸ“– Essentials or the Prerequisite

Some of the parts are solved lately by the young master, Cheuikalla. He is the most talented young guy in this town. Well without further a do, I must find this guy and learn about the *puzzle of the immersive youth*.

I live as an old man, reigning my kingdom for about 125 years to be exact. As getting older and older, the time passed by so quickly.

I want the antidote to my elderly phase. To rule the *Empire*, I need to be tough as I was before. My former *right-hand* told me about this kind of choices that I should pick in order to get my adolescent back again.

You can guess though, the first one its the *Almighty Water of The Juvenile Deer*. It is a myth to be honest ( I believe in a myth about this ***deer*** ) so it might be impossible to search about this in the entire world.

The second one, its a sacrificing method. Well I did not like this one, killing my children, descendants, successors maybe bad ( and one day I might be caught doing this damned action ).

The third one ( also the last option ), its to discover the *puzzle of the immersive youth*. I said above that I believe in a myth but as I hear the sound of it, maybe this thing exist once in our lifetime.

So I go searching, walking, made a journey around the world to obtain the information about it until I perceived the great *Cheuikalla*.

## ðŸ“– Ruler of Aeignomineey

*Aeignomineey*, derived from the past and the present..

Is well known because of its humiliation, shame, indignity, and embarrassment of its people and society. They were exist on my absolute monarchy for about 25 years. It covers the most southern part of the *Empire* and never be touched by any strangers. They usually pass this land and move onto the next one which is the *Town of Daes Penz Yer*.

Forget the *Daes Penz Yer*, as that is the town for the curious and peculiar person to land there. People encountered this city because they want to spend their golds, dispense anything they had to earn any rare items. As a king, I have all the goods so its useless.

Back to the path...

I pursue the road of madness, riding my horse until I saw a blaze of fire. I gone by myself and this became an unexpected turn. I dismount my horse, walk down slowly to see what is going on.

Alas, it turned to be a dead person. Maybe somebody killed him on his journey, what a pity.

Mount my horse and saddle up again until I reach *Aeignomineey*.

People knows their king and ruler of the *Empire*. Who I was, where I came from, and such. But in this really nice disguise, I should not be recognized as I walk through the city and go past the market. I heard people chattering about their lord...

*Cheuikalla*.

The Young, Master of Alchemy and Potions,  and the famous herbalist. The legend said that only him, who knew how to solve the *puzzle of the immersive youth*.

I need see him and tell my story, there is a reason why I want to be a dictator. All of my scions are not tough, easy to be manipulated, and of course they are all ruling not because to lead people to the truth and joyful campaign, but only for the root of all evil...

The **gold**.

## ðŸ“– 3 Blocks

The lord of the youth is only 6 years old, but he can speak, think, and act like any real king so he is old enough to be promoted. Yes, promoted. He was the direct family of the king before, it is pretty obvious why he is chosen.

He does know me before I came to the town, he could foresee the future also, so what I am doing perhaps not going any further with him ( as he can see what I am thinking about ).

When I knock the castle, the guards show up and told me why I want to go inside. Of course to met their lord, why ask if *Cheuikalla* could see my arrival. Turns out only small of the region and mere mortals who knew his powers including me, as I storm through he told me from far away to tell the guard some really secret code and that is *Cheuik Mate*. 

I spoke the all of the guards in front of me, in rage and honesty I yelled so loud.

They are stunned and mesmerized, surprisingly let me through the passage easily without holding back. So I rush to the throne just to see him. I am 127 years old, the rush was not that fast ( you can imagine how hard it could be just for me to ran across the guards, the castle until I finished at the throne room ).

As I opened the door, *Cheuikalla* was in the famous ***zen*** mode. I did not want to disturb him, so I sat down and talk to him within my brain. As I send my messages, he responded all of it instantly as the message had come by itself first before I told him.

He said, "*3 Blocks*".

I have no idea about anything he said. Just 2 words containing a number and an object. No clue, no hints, just 2 words.

As I woken up, my soul left my body in unconscious state. I thought I was dead at the moment, but no the challenge is up ahead and I need to get through all of the phases that already been set by the lord of youth.

I need my adolescent power, I crave all the bravery, the courage and the power that I could use once again to rule the *Empire*.

I fly through the first road and encountered a turn, I picked up a sword and suddenly everything are transforming into another realm and my body regain its power.

But I cannot go back to my body just yet because I need to obtain this blocks and re-arrange them into what I need for the *puzzle of the immersive youth*. So I can achieve immortality.
