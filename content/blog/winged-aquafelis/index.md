## Verse 1: Water

Sometimes, I saw a shiny braces within your arms and I don't really want to know
about it. Its been to long since I met you 5 months ago. Do you realize that
wherever you are, I'm always being there *beside* you ?

Everytime I see those glimpse on your eyes, something always come down
thoroughly.

> Choosing between good or evil, either fo those choices always have an answer.

## Verse 2: Pour those liquids

'*I do not need any answers*.' She said all the things that really made my mind
shattering, pushes my brain's neurons into something crazy. Well, she is also
**crazy**. Sooner or later I'll get caught, yes I know. I did really bad things
and needs to be *punished*. But as far as I know, this *bad* thing is really
worthy and  I should do it!

## Verse 3: Cursed?

And now I get it. Karma does its job really well I think. You get slapped by
those thick arms of **bollocks** you were trying to say yesterday. Well, I guess
I should do her a favor. What is it? Could it be a gift? Or should I buy her a
pet, like cats or dogs?

> Strange things happens fast, but before that, thinking of you is my 5-seconds
> routine.
